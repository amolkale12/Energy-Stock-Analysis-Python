Daily energy stock analysis projected developed in python which compares the three different stocks. 
We used simple visualizations to presents the findings in terms of Moving avg, closing price,starting price, risk, 
and prediction after 365 days. For a risk analysis we used two methods as bootstrap and monte carlo method. 
This portfolio project will be looking data from the stock market particularly some energy stocks. We tried to visualize different aspects
of the data and two different ways to analyse the risk of stock, based on its previous performance status.

2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?

All the findings and code is available as follows::
